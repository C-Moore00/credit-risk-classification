Module 20 Challenge!

Another quick one (relatively)!
Once more, my prior course I'd taken on Machine Learning came in quite handy, and it was a fairly quick one.

Ironically, the longest part was attempting to utilise imbalancedlearn - Eventually, I downgraded my sklearn and got it working, only to check the rubric and see that it's not even there!
Probably should've checked that first before going through the effort. Ah, well. Only one to go, then I'm passing! I reckon I'll finish the rest anyway, just to be more comfortable.

All code here is taken from my work prior and classwork.
